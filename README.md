# Income Differences by Education: USA
This repository analyzes the Adult Census Income dataset, comparing demographic and employment information for individuals making either above $50k per year or below. 

## Purpose of this Repository 
- The purpose of this repository is to create a computational analysis of U.S. income data as it correlates with education levels: High School Graduates compared to those with a Bachelors degree
- By following the instructional Python notebook, users can produce a meerged data set comparing the education levels.
- This information can be used to create models and predictions for income, along with other interesting characteristics, such as marital status or gender.

## Contents 
- contains the raw data set, [adult.csv] as well as the newly created subset, [EducationLevelDifferences.csv] which are both located within the files at the top of the repository 



## Where the Data is From
- The [raw dataset ](https://github.com/caitdwyer27/Income-Differences-by-Education/blob/main/adult.csv)was retrieved from [Kaggle
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lovishbansal123/adult-census-income/data) , an online data science competition platform.
- The demographical information/contents of the dataset have been collected from the U.S. Census Bureau, a government agency.
- The [subset ](https://github.com/caitdwyer27/Income-Differences-by-Education/blob/main/EducationLevelDifferences.csv)was created through computational anylysis of income statistics by education levels, using *Google Colabratory*

## Visualizing this Data
- Being able to picture and analyze this data set is highly important for observing trends between education and income
- First, we can visualize the amount of High School Graduates making more than (>) $50,000/year versus less than or equal to (<=) $50,000/year.
- This data is presented by a bar chart to give a sense of comparison between the amount of people in either income bracket.

- Next we can use the same visualization for those with a Bachelors degree
![Bachelors Degree](https://github.com/caitdwyer27/Income-Differences-by-Education/assets/167785344/2459ec00-6b21-4a97-bb24-b2f2d8a8d549)
*Data visualizations were created using [datawisp
](https://www.datawisp.io/datavisualization?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21168774683&utm_term=&utm_content=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_qexBhCoARIsAFgBleuw-DoHuFZMCyfd8ymB_qtktHqNOeJ5TZzAVQVLKgFHRV-HHZDjm3YaAmrkEALw_wcB)*

- With this illustration of our data, we can see a clear trends between having a High School degree as opposed to having a Bachelors degree when it comes to the amount of income made.
